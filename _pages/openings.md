### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

There are PhD and Postdoc scholarships available.  I'd be happy to support you to apply via our group. Take a look for instance at the [Wellcome Trust Doctoral Studentships](https://wellcome.ac.uk/grant-funding/schemes/four-year-phd-programmes-studentships-basic-scientists){:target="_blank"} or at the [Marie Curie fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm){:target="_blank"}.

### Master projects 
If you are a Master's student at University of Nottingham looking for a project, contact me (or any group member) via email or stop by my office.
